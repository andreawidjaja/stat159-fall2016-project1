<p>Before we begin, it is important for us to know the foundation behind Reproducible Research and why you might consider using it more often. The concept of Reproducible Research relies heavily on the idea of The Scientific Method. In science, an experiment is reproducible. &quot;Why?&quot; You might ask. Scientific experiments rely heavily on evidence from data in which, hypothesis are usually tested from observations. For scientific research, to reproduce is to conduct the same experiment with a different set up. This similar concept applies to Reproducible Research. In order for data or code to be reproducible, it should be accessible to the public. The transparency that this tool of collaboration provides, demonstrates that it is heavily evidence-based and that the results are reliable and valid.</p>
<p>This paper is, indeed, an example of a reproducible paper. I will show you how to produce your own reproducible research paper step-by-step. First of all, we have to be familiar with the five tools that I have utilized for this reproducible paper. They are Git, GitHub, Makefile, Markdown, and pandoc.</p>
<p>I will then further discuss the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions of each tool</li>
<li>role each tool plays in writing this reproducible paper</li>

<h3 id="markdown">Markdown</h3>
<p><img src="../images/markdown-logo.png" alt="Stat159" /><br />
As you read through this paper, have you ever paused and wondered... &quot;How did she make the list above? or &quot;How did she change the header size?&quot; If yes, then I might just have the perfect answer to your questions. That is, of course, Markdown. As a matter of fact, this paper you are reading right now is an example of a Markdown. Markdown is a text-based markup that can be used to create creative and easy to read documents.</p>
<p>Markdown provides simple, intuitive formatting elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>This unordered list can be created by adding a <code>*</code> in front of each item
<ul>
<li>To make a nested list like this, simply indent one level</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can have ordered list by starting each item with a number <code>1.</code>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>This is</li>
<li>an ordered list</li>
</ol></li>
<li>You also can have different header sizes
<ul>
<li>header sizes are indicated by the number of <code>#</code>s in front of the header</li>
<li><code># Discussion</code> for the &quot;Discussion&quot; header</li>
<li><code>### Markdown</code> for the &quot;Markdown&quot; header</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To make inline codes like above, simply type in ``` at the front and back of the word</li>
<li>You can format/style your words
<ul>
<li>You can have them <strong>bold</strong> by typing in <code>**bold**</code></li>
<li>You can also have the words <em>italic</em> by typing in <code>*italic*</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can also add images like the Markdown logo above
<ul>
<li>Simply follow this <code>![](../images/markdown-logo.png)</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>For further information on Markdown, you can simply check out this <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Tutorial</a>

<li>The code to add that link is:</li>

<p>For this paper, my first step was to write my Markdown in any text editor. I chose <strong>MacDown</strong> because I was most familiar with it. To make things simpler, Markdown is basically like Microsoft Word, except it is used to design web pages. In order for me to continue to my next step, I need a document converter to convert my Markdown file into a HTML file.</p>
<h2 id="document-conversion">Document Conversion</h2>
<h3 id="pandoc">pandoc</h3>
<p><img src="../images/pandoc-logo.png" alt="Stat159" /><br />
An example of a document converter is Pandoc. Before you get started, make sure that you have pandoc instsalled in your computer. Pandoc is a universal document converter that can convert files from one markup format into another. It is a command-line tool that converts files between document formats such as markdown, LaTeX, HTML, Microsoft Word.Docx, and PDF.</p>
<p>After finishing my Markdown, I used pandoc to convert Markdown into a HTML file.<br />
By default, typing</p>
<pre><code>pandoc doc.md </code></pre>
<p>in the Terminal converts a file written in markdown into a HTML file.<br />
Alternatively, you can also write it this way:</p>
<pre><code>pandoc -f html -t markdown doc.md</code></pre>
<p>The code above shows that pandoc converts (-f) from HTML (-t) to a markdown document called &quot;doc.md&quot;.<br />
Pandoc is beneficial for everyone because it gives people access to the files they need. With research files being available and easily accessible, this introduces the idea of data transparency and efficiency in Reproducible Research.</p>
<h2 id="version-control">Version Control</h2>
<p>A common problem that researchers generally face is to manage changes. During the course of writing your own reproducible research, you will most like have to deal with adding new information or discoveries, modifying details, or deleting a text you might want to undo. Logically, you can do this by making copy of the original file, and editing the duplicated file. Sounds familiar? I am sure you have done this at least once in your lifetime. Editing the duplicated file to track changes might seem the perfect solution because it is very simple. However, what happens when you have to track the changes made to the original document more than once? It is surely going to be a hassle to manage the multiple variations made. This is when a version control system steps in.<br />
#### Git <img src="../images/git-logo.png" alt="Stat159" /></p>
<p>Git is an example of a version control software. It autamatically keeps track of the changes made to a file or set of files over time so that you can revert files back to their previous states. It is a distributed open source medium which allows collaboration between researchers. This promotes reproducibility. To access Git, I used the command line (Terminal). Git allows me to track every pictures I added or paragraphs I modified, and compare it from the previous versions to see which one I like better.</p>
<p>Examples of <code>git</code> commands:</p>
<pre><code>git init: creates a new Git repository  
git status: show working tree status  
git push: update remote  
git commit: record changes to the repository  
git log: shows log of what has been committed  
git diff: shows what you have changed  
git rm and mv: remove and move files</code></pre>
<h4 id="github">GitHub</h4>
<p><img src="../images/github-logo.png" alt="Stat159" /><br />
Git stores information on changes on files into a data structure called a repository. GitHub is a website service that hosts git repositories online publically or privately. As one of the online website service with the largest storage space, GitHub provides users the opportunity to collaborate with other users. GitHub is also known for its &quot;forking&quot; abilities. This allows users to utilize previously published repositories and reproduce their own project from it. To summarize, not only does GitHub act as a social networking medium in which users build their profile, upload projects, and connect with other users, but it also act as a resume to showcase completed projects.<br />
Additionally, GitHub is also used to ease the graders in grading this paper.</p>
<h2 id="program-building-unix-tool">Program Building (Unix Tool)</h2>
<h3 id="makefile">Makefile</h3>
<p>Compiling code files can be very inefficient, especially if you have to repititively type the command lines every time you want to do it. Don't worry! In an era where almost everything is instant and convenient, Makefile gives you a shortcut to execute the commands recipe by simply running the <code>make</code>program.</p>
<p>A Makefile is a Unix tool that is often used to simplify the organization of code compilation. It is a text file named &quot;Makefile&quot; that contains shell commands. Generally, a makefile contains a list of rules that tell the system what commands you want to be executed. These rules are oftentimes commands to compile a series of files or remove certain files as a clean up operation. Before starting, make sure that you have <code>make</code> installed in you comuter, so that you can execute the Makefile.<br />
##### Basic Makefile rule structure:</p>
<pre><code>target: dependencies
[tab]commands</code></pre>
<p>Our goal here is to build the <em>target</em> file, from the <em>dependencies</em> source files.</p>
<p>An exerpt of the Makefile rule I used to compile this paper:</p>
<pre><code>.PHONY: paper.md paper.html clean
paper/paper.html: paper/paper.md
    cd paper; pandoc paper.md -s -o paper.html

paper/paper.md: paper/sections/00-abstract.md paper/sections/01-introduction.md paper/sections/02-discussion.md paper/sections/03-conclusions.md
    cd paper/sections; pandoc *.md -s -o paper.md
    cd paper/sections; mv paper.md ../

clean:
    rm -f paper/paper.html paper/paper.md</code></pre>
<p>Notice that this paper is divided into 4 sections from the <a href="https://github.com/andreawidjaja/stat159-fall2016-project1/tree/master/paper/sections">sections folder</a>, and that Makefile is needed to compile these 4 files, which are <em>dependencies</em>, into one file called <code>paper.md</code>, the <em>target</em> file.</p>
<p>Command used to build the target file: <code>cd paper/sections; pandoc *.md -s -o paper.md</code><br />
To simplify things, an <code>*.md</code> is used to indicate all the dependent files with the extention <code>.md</code>.</p>
<p>An example of command used to do a clean-up operation:<br />
<code>clean: rm -f paper/paper.html paper/paper.md</code> This removes output files after compilation. The flag -f is used to avoid displaying error message if the output files do not exist.</p>
<p><code>.PHONY</code> is not really the name of a target file, but rather, the name of a recipe of actions to be performed.</p>
<p>After completing your Makefile, then you can run <em>make</em> program by typing in <code>make</code> into the command-line. This will search for a file called makefile in your directory and execute the commands inside the Makefile. If you have several makefiles, then you can specify which target you want makefile to execute by typing in <code>make &lt;specific target name&gt;</code>. To execute the clean up operations, you can simply type in <code>make clean</code>.</p>

<h4 id="difficulty-challenges-solution">Difficulty, Challenges &amp; Solution</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Personally, I feel that the easier parts making this reproducible paper was to format and type the markdown document. Since I was familiar with HTML and R Markdown, I was able to put my creativity into practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The most challenging parts for me was to explain the concepts and ideas behind each tool in a way that everyone can completely understand. Additionally, I also find it difficult to make my discussion flow better for people to understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the very first challenges I faced was during Monday's Lab. I created a test file called <code>try.md</code> and committed it to the repository. I had difficulties removing the <code>try.md</code> file. It turns out that I had to use <code>git rm try.md</code> instead of <code>rm try.md</code> in order for my local file to match my repository on GitHub.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Another challenge I was stuck with is the Makefile. After executing <code>make</code>, the <code>paper.md</code> was successfully updated whereas, the <code>paper.html</code> wasn't. It turns out that I have to switch the order of the targets due to dependency.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I was also stuck in getting the picture to appear in my HTML file. To tackle this situation, I had to remove all the pictures and re-downloaded them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, by going to Prof. Gaston Sanchez's office hour, I was able to tackle several of my challenges.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="time-consumed">Time Consumed</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The most time consuming parts of this project is creating the framework and file structure on Monday's lab, and writing the contents of this paper.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It took me around 12 hours to complete this project.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion"># Conclusion</h2>
<p>Writing this reproducible paper made me realize an even greater importance of reproducibility in research. Reproducible research is beneficial in a way that it can be very efficient and minimize possible errors. I have discussed with you the five tools needed to reproduce your own research, which are: Git, GitHub, Markdown, pandoc, and Makefile. The structure this reproducible paper sets reflects the steps needed for future reproducible researches. Since it was the very first time for me, I believe that I have gained the knowledge and technical skills for Reproducibility Research.</p>
