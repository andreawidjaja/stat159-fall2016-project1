<p>How To Make Your Own Reproducible Research<br />
Author: Widjaja, Andrea</p>
<p>In every scientific research, technology are often used by scientists to collect, analyze, and publish data. With computational science rapidly growing as technology advances, researchers have been calling more and more attention to Reproducible Research. Reproducible Research enables researchers to reuse, modify and extend previous published codes and data. This promotes researchers to collaborate with one another. In this paper, I will discuss the concepts and tools that can be utilized to promote reproducibility in research.</p>
<p>Sections: * Abstract * Introduction<br />
* Version Control * Git * GitHub * Document Conversion * pandoc * GNU Software * makefile * Typesetting/Formatting Language * Markdown * Discussion * Resources for this reproducible project * &quot;easy&quot; parts * Challenging Parts (most time consuming, things stuck with) * Receive help? * How much time? * Conclusion</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Before we begin, it is important for us to know the foundation behind Reproducible Research. The concept of Reproducible Research relies heavily on the idea of The Scientific Method. In science, an experiment is reproducible. &quot;Why?&quot; You might ask. Scientific experiments rely heavily on evidence from data in which, hypothesis are usually tested from observations. This similar concept applies to Reproducible Resesarch. In order for data or code to be reproducible, they should be accessible to the public. The transparency that this tool of collaboration provides contributes to the validity of the published research, which demonstrates that it is heavily evidence based and that the results are reliable.</p>
<p>These are five tools that are utilized for this reproducible workflow:<br />
1. Git <img src="../images/git-logo.png" /> 2. GitHub <img src="../images/github-logo.png" /> 3. Makefile 4. Markdown <img src="../images/markdown-logo.png" /> 5. pandoc <img src="../images/pandoc-logo.png" /></p>
<p>The topics I will discuss are the following:<br />
* functions of each tool<br />
* role each tool plays in this reproducible workflow</p>
<h2 id="version-control">Version Control</h2>
<p><img src="../images/git-logo.png" /> * ### Git version control software for keeping track of the history of code and text. help collaborate with researchers. keep tracks of changes over time. allows you to track progress. allows you to revert to earlier version. git help git confic git init git status git add git commit git log git diff<br />
<img src="../images/github-logo.png" /> * ### GitHub web service that hosts git repositories online and in public/private. ## GNU Software ### Makefile askjflakjfla ## Typesetting/Formatting Language <img src="../images/markdown-logo.png" /> ### Markdown Markdown is text-based markup that can be used to creaty easy to read documents that can be converted into different formats such as HTML, PDF, docx. a simplified version of “markup” language. no special editor required. simple intuitive formatting elements.<br />
## Document Conversion <img src="../images/pandoc-logo.png" /> ### pandoc it is command line tool. universal document converter. can convert markdown into HTML, PDF, dock.</p>
