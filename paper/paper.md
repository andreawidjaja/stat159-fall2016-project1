How To Make Your Own Reproducible Research\
Author: Widjaja, Andrea

In every scientific research, technology are often used by scientists to
collect, analyze, and publish data. With computational science rapidly
growing as technology advances, researchers have been calling more and
more attention to Reproducible Research. Reproducible Research enables
researchers to reuse, modify and extend previous published codes and
data. This promotes researchers to collaborate with one another. In this
paper, I will discuss the concepts and tools that can be utilized to
promote reproducibility in research.

Introduction
============

Before we begin, it is important for us to know the foundation behind
Reproducible Research. The concept of Reproducible Research relies
heavily on the idea of The Scientific Method. In science, an experiment
is reproducible. "Why?" You might ask. Scientific experiments rely
heavily on evidence from data in which, hypothesis are usually tested
from observations. This similar concept applies to Reproducible
Resesarch. In order for data or code to be reproducible, they should be
accessible to the public. The transparency that this tool of
collaboration provides contributes to the validity of the published
research, which demonstrates that it is heavily evidence based and that
the results are reliable.

These are five tools that are utilized for this reproducible workflow:\
1. Git ![](../images/git-logo.png) 2. GitHub
![](../images/github-logo.png) 3. Makefile 4. Markdown
![](../images/markdown-logo.png) 5. pandoc

The topics I will discuss are the following:\
\* functions of each tool\
\* role each tool plays in this reproducible workflow

Version Control
---------------

![](../images/git-logo.png) \* \#\#\# Git version control software for
keeping track of the history of code and text. help collaborate with
researchers. keep tracks of changes over time. allows you to track
progress. allows you to revert to earlier version. git help git confic
git init git status git add git commit git log git diff\
![](../images/github-logo.png) \* \#\#\# GitHub web service that hosts
git repositories online and in public/private. \#\# GNU Software \#\#\#
Makefile askjflakjfla \#\# Typesetting/Formatting Language
![](../images/markdown-logo.png) \#\#\# Markdown Markdown is text-based
markup that can be used to creaty easy to read documents that can be
converted into different formats such as HTML, PDF, docx. a simplified
version of “markup” language. no special editor required. simple
intuitive formatting elements.\
\#\# Document Conversion ![](../images/pandoc-logo.png) \#\#\# pandoc it
is command line tool. universal document converter. can convert markdown
into HTML, PDF, dock.
