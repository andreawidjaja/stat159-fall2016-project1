# Conclusion
-------------

Writing this reproducible paper made me realize an even greater importance of reproducibility in research. Reproducible research is beneficial in a way that it can be very efficient and minimize possible errors. I have discussed with you the five tools needed to reproduce your own research, which are: Git, GitHub, Markdown, pandoc, and Makefile. The structure this reproducible paper sets reflects the steps needed for future reproducible researches. Since it was the very first time for me, I believe that I have gained the knowledge and technical skills for Reproducibility Research.
