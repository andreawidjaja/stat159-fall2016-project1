# Introduction

--------------------

Before we begin, it is important for us to know the foundation behind Reproducible Research and why you might consider using it more often. The concept of Reproducible Research relies heavily on the idea of The Scientific Method. In science, an experiment is reproducible. "Why?" You might ask. Scientific experiments rely heavily on evidence from data in which, hypothesis are usually tested from observations. For scientific research, to reproduce is to conduct the same experiment with a different set up. This similar concept applies to Reproducible Research. In order for data or code to be reproducible, it should be accessible to the public. The transparency that this tool of collaboration provides, demonstrates that it is heavily evidence-based and that the results are reliable and valid.  

This paper is, indeed, an example of a reproducible paper. I will show you how to produce your own reproducible research paper step-by-step. First of all, we have to be familiar with the five tools that I have utilized for this reproducible paper. They are Git, GitHub, Makefile, Markdown, and pandoc.  


I will then further discuss the following topics: 

* Functions of each tool
* role each tool plays in writing this reproducible paper
