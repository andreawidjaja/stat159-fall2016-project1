# Abstract

How To Make Your Own Reproducible Research  
Author: Widjaja, Andrea

In every scientific research, technology are often used by scientists to collect, analyze, and publish data. With computational science rapidly growing as technology advances, researchers have been calling more and more attention to Reproducible Research. Reproducible Research enables researchers to reuse, modify and extend previous published codes and data. This promotes researchers to collaborate with one another. In this paper, I will discuss the concepts and tools that can be utilized to promote reproducibility in research.
